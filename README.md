<p class="ui header product-top-header" title=" Sprint 1 Solution">Hub Travel has come to the Agile Baker Agency with a project to build a distance calculator program. The project was originally being developed by another agency, but after thirteen months, they only had started to write the program. (To be fair, they did have some nice PowerPoint presentations of what they intended to accomplish.) You have been given the code that was developed so far. Your first assignment will be to get the code to run correctly.

Agile Baker uses the Scrum method of program development. Each week’s goal, called a story, is accomplished in a fixed length of time, called a sprint. At Agile Baker you run in sprints of one week duration. Each story is broken into tasks, which are accomplished individually. At the opening of a sprint you select one of the available tasks and announce it on the team discussion board to the rest of your team. At the beginning of each day during the daily scrum meeting you tell the group briefly what you have done, what you are going to do, and any difficulties you have encountered. Also, since we have no automated source code repository, you will need to let the team know when you check out the latest copy of the project and when you return it with your changes. Also be sure to make the appropriate changes to the name of the zip file so that you will know the latest version of the project. At the end of a sprint, there is a presentation to the shareholders of your progress. This presentation is just a copy of each team’s project (the .exe file) placed in the weekly discussion board for the entire class to view. Your score for each sprint is based equally on your individual efforts and your efforts as a team. If you need help with a task but don’t say anything, then the whole team suffers. Be sure to take advantage of the daily scrum meetings to get any help you need. Since there are more tasks than team members, some of you will have the opportunity of completing more than one task.

Story:    As a PC user I want a working distance calculator program that calculates the distance in miles between two hub airports.

Task 1: Correct the event handlers for the two ComboBoxes.

Task 1a: Remove the syntax errors from ID1ComboBox_SelectedIndexChanged  and ID2ComboBox_SelectedIndexChanged  so that the code will compile.

Task 1b: Correct the logical errors that prevent the correct values for City, Latitude, and Longitude from displaying below the selected airport ID in ID1ComboBox and ID2ComboBox.

Task 1c: Add documentation to your code to explain what it is meant to do.

Task 1d: Check out the master copy of the project and install your changes.

Task 2:  Correct the event handler for the left CalcButton.

Task 2a: Remove the syntax errors from Calc1Button_Click so that the code will compile.

Task2b:   Correct the logical errors that prevent the correct values from showing for a test case. (Pressing the button should convert Atlanta’s latitude to 33.63944 and longitude to 84.42806.) You will have to set the inputs manually in order to compile and test your code.

Task 2c: Add documentation to your code to explain what it is meant to do.

Task 2d: Check out the master copy of the project and install your changes.

Task 3:  Correct the event handler for the right CalcButton.

Task 3a: Remove the syntax errors from Calc2Button_Click so that the code will compile.

Task3b:   Correct the logical errors that prevent the correct values from showing for a test case. (Pressing the button should convert Boston’s latitude to 42.36167 and longitude to 71.01167.) You will have to set the inputs manually in order to compile and test your code.

Task 3c: Add documentation to your code to explain what it is meant to do.

Task 3d: Check out the master copy of the project and install your changes.

Task 4:  Correct the event handler for the CalcDistanceButton.

Task4a:   Remove the syntax errors from CalcDistanceButton_Click so that the code will compile.

Task4b:   Correct the logical errors that prevent the correct mileage from showing for a test case. (Pressing the button should show a distance of 945 miles between Atlanta and Boston.) You will have to set the inputs manually in order to compile and test your code.

Task 4c: Add documentation to your code to explain what it is meant to do.

Task 4d: Check out the master copy of the project and install your changes.

Task 5: Do a final check and publish results in the Weekly Discussion Board.

Task 5a: Check out the master copy of the project and test each Control on the form to assure that selecting ATL in the combo boxes displays Atlanta’s latitude as 33° 38’ 22” and longitude as 84° 25′ 41″, pressing the Calculate Bearings button changes Atlanta’s latitude to 33.63944 and longitude to 84.42806, and pressing the Calculate Distance button displays the distance between Atlanta and Boston as 945 miles.

Task 5b: On Wednesday, after the completion of all other tasks, insert the most recent copy of AirportDistances.exe in the Weekly Discussion Board for your team.
